# grunt-adapter

`grunt-adapter` allows to execute `grunt` plugins without grunt itself. This can be useful if you want to execute certain plugins in other environments.

> This is very much work in progress! It is more likely it doesn't work that it does. My primary goal was to make [grunt-cloudflare](https://github.com/strathausen/grunt-cloudflare) run without `grunt`.
